BreakoutGameRemake

  Most of this code was gathered from this site: http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/breakout/ by author Jan Bodnar.  You can view the original code and my modified code side-by-side.  I have added my own sound effects, images and have also improved on the collision detection amongst other additions.  And yes, if you can see it - I am using an image of Professor Phillips' head as the pong ball :).
